    "For my Capstone project I will be using data provided by UBER Movement, a database of ride information provided by UBER, to analyze the driving times from my place of work.  This area is of particular importance to me as I commute to work 5 days a weeks and I am currently in the process of looking for a new place to live.  I would like to find out what areas around Boston are most impacted by the traffic caused by Red Sox home games.  \n",
